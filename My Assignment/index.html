  <h1>History Of Tea</h1>
      <br>
      <p>Tea has been using since prehistoric time in north western China as medicine and food (Sheng
        2001, in (Weatherstone 1986; Modder 2002). According to one of the Chinese
        legends, the Emperor of China and inventor of agriculture and Chinese medicine, Shen
        Nung, was drinking a bowl of just boiled water due to a decree that his subjects must boil
        water before drinking in sometime around 2737 BC when a few leaves were blown from a
        nearby tree into his water, changing the colour. The emperor took a sip of the brew and was
        pleasantly surprised by its flavor and restorative properties. A variant of the legend tells that
        the emperor tested the medical properties of various herbs on *himself, some of them
        poisonous, and found tea to work as an antidote. The emperor came in to believe that tea had
        beneficial effects on health and recommended it as remedy for various ailments as kidney
        trouble, fever, chest infection and tumors (Fernando 2001). The recent research has amazingly
        confirmed these findings.</p>

      <h1>Introduction About Tea</h1>
      <br>
       <P>Tea was introduced in 1867, Ceylon Tea has grown to be the top agriculture export in Sri Lanka and provides direct and indirect employment to nearly 1 million people while around 4% of the country's land area is covered in tea plantations amounting to nearly 203000 hectares. Sri Lanka is an island made for tea.The 'Stafford' tea estate was developed during the pioneering times of the Ceylon tea industry. Tea was first grown commercially in Ceylon (which became Sri Lanka in 1972) by Scotsman James Taylor in 1867, on a coffee estate named 'Loolecondera', in the central hill capital of Kandy.

        A while later, a deadly blight ravaged the coffee plantations of which Ceylon 's economy was dependent on. The enterprising planters, immediately turned to expanding their crop to Tea, as the best alternative. Within a decade of planting there were over 5000 acres of tea growing in the hills of Kandy and Nuwara Eliya.
        
        Sir Arthur Conan Doyle , in one of his works ,pays the following tribute to the Ceylon Planters who successfully overcame the disaster that followed in the wake of the baleful fungus.
        
        "Not often is it that men have the heart, when their one great industry is withered, to rear up in a few years another as rich to take its place, and the tea fields of Ceylon are as true a monument to courage as is the Lion of Waterloo."
