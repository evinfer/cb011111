  <h2>History Of Tea</h2>
      <br>
      <h5>Tea has been using since prehistoric time in north western China as medicine and food (Sheng
        2001, in (Weatherstone 1986; Modder 2002). According to one of the Chinese
        legends, the Emperor of China and inventor of agriculture and Chinese medicine, Shen
        Nung, was drinking a bowl of just boiled water due to a decree that his subjects must boil
        water before drinking in sometime around 2737 BC when a few leaves were blown from a
        nearby tree into his water, changing the colour. The emperor took a sip of the brew and was
        pleasantly surprised by its flavor and restorative properties. A variant of the legend tells that
        the emperor tested the medical properties of various herbs on *himself, some of them
        poisonous, and found tea to work as an antidote. The emperor came in to believe that tea had
        beneficial effects on health and recommended it as remedy for various ailments as kidney
        trouble, fever, chest infection and tumors (Fernando 2001). The recent research has amazingly
        confirmed these findings.It was as far back as the year 1824 in which the British brought a tea 
        plant from China to Ceylon (as Sri Lanka was known at the time). It was planted in the Royal 
        Botanical Gardens, Peradeniya and is considered to have been the first non-commercial tea plant 
        in Sri Lanka.After nearly two decades in 1867, James Taylor, Scottish by origin, planted 19 acres 
        of tea in the city of Kandy in Ceylon, at the Loolecondra Estate as the first commercial tea plantation.
        The eventual sale of Loolecondra teas resulted in 1872, in Kandy and the first tea consignment to 
        London in 1873. These pioneering efforts were done by trial and error and improved over the years via 
        the introduction and improvement of tea processing machines and methods, by different individuals and 
        companies.The first broking firm John Brothers & Co. was established in 1876 and the first public
        Colombo auction took place in 1883 under the guidance of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce
        (which was established in 1839). The Colombo Tea Traders' Association was formed in 1894 
        and in 1925 the Tea Research Institute was established. These organizations helped boost the 
        production and export of Ceylon Teas in its early stages.</h5>

      <h2>Introduction About Tea</h2>
      <br>
       <h5>Tea was introduced in 1867, Ceylon Tea has grown to be the top agriculture export in 
          Sri Lanka and provides direct and indirect employment to nearly 1 million people while 
          around 4% of the country's land area is covered in tea plantations amounting to nearly 
          203000 hectares. Sri Lanka is an island made for tea.Ceylon Tea from Sri Lanka, acclaimed 
          as thebest tea in the world has its inherent unique characteristics and reputation running through
          more than a century. The influence of climaticconditions of its plantations imparts to the
          product, a variety of flavours and aromas,synonymous with quality.Sri Lanka is renowned for its 
          high quality tea and as the 3rd biggest tea producing country globally, has a production share
          of 9% in the international sphere. It is one of the world's leading exporters with a share of 
          around 23% of the global demand. The total extent of land under tea cultivation has been assessed an 
          approximately 187,309 hectares. The tea industry is found as a major partner for more than a century
          in Sri Lanka's economy. The tea industry serves as our country's forex and source and employment.
          However, looking at the statistics from a few years ago, the tea industry's contribution is said to 
          be flawed. But, when you look at the past years, you can see gradual improvements. Moreover, 
          Sri Lankan tea has a unique place in the global market. Sri Lanka has to resort to various strategies
          and policies in order to maintain it's position in the global marketplace. Therefore, the problems 
          faced by the tea industry can be solved and the development of the Sri Lankan tea industry can be 
          intensified while incorporating sophisticated technologies. In view of the difficulties faced by 
          the tea industry in Sri Lanka, the planting rate is low, productivity is low, tea growing land is 
          stagnant or shrinking, production is high and labour shortage is high. This is due to fluctuations 
          in exports and production in the tea industry. Finally, some strategies are proposed to improve the 
          competitiveness of Sri Lanka in the global tea industry and the role of the tea industry in the
          Sri Lankan economy and other aspects of the tea industry, such as location and other factors, 
          raw material availability and demand
